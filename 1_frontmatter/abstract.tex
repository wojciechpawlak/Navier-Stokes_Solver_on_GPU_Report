\chapter{Abstract}
This report is intended as a summary of project work done for individual special course \enquote{A GPU-accelerated Navier-Stokes Solver using OpenCL}. It describes the design and implementation of a CFD solver targeted for a GPU platform. The solution was implemented in OpenCL on basis of legacy code, optimized in some extent. The project was tested and analyzed.

Furthermore, essential theoretical details behind the solver are summarized. Report is also a guide over current state of GPGPU programming in general and OpenCL technology in particular. It may serve as brief handbook of good practices as the report consists of description of solutions to challanges that arose during development.

Although NVIDIA was a primary development platform and the report is mainly based on experiences with it, the content can be extended to wider scope of GPGPU programming. The report is concluded with general outcomes, enumeration of possible improvements and proposals for future work.
