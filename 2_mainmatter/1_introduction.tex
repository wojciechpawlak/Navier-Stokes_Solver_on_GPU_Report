\chapter{Introduction}
The goal of this report is to document the work done for individual special course \enquote{A GPU-accelerated Navier-Stokes Solver using OpenCL}. The project took place in GPUlab of Scientific Computing Section of Department of Informatics and Mathematical Modeling (DTU Informatics) at Technical University of Denmark. The project work for this special course took place between late March until early August 2012 and was supervised by Allan P. Engsig-Karup Ph.D. The course was worth 5 ECTS points.

The practical goal of this project was to design and implement a scientific computing application for execution on GPUs. The implemented application was then verified and validated using standard benchmarks. 

The performance of implemented PDE solver was analyzed.

Apply optimization techniques for improving performance of PDE solver on GPUs.

Understand how to write a parallel program using OpenCL for heterogenous computing on many-core architectures.

Apply basic principles for numerical approximation/discretization.
